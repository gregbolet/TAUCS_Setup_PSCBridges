Here are the steps you should follow to setup TAUCS on your bridges.psc.edu account.

1 - Extract the TAUCS program files to said directory and enter that directory
2 - Copy 'linux_intelmkl.mk' into the 'config' directory
3 - Download and make METIS (v4.0.3); change the 'linux_intelmkl.mk' file contents to point to your METIS files
4 - Go to the folder where you extracted TAUCS and run: './configure variant=_intelmkl'
5 - Then run 'make' (may take a minute or two)
6 - To make and run the test scripts run: './testscript variant=_intelmkl'
7 - Look at the 'testscript.log' file to verify that the tests passed
8 - You're all set!

Notes: This variant excludes the Cilk modules. 
       If everything above is done correctly, the tests should all pass.
